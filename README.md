## Overview

A.I Dots is a simulation where a population of dots have an objective to reach the blue goal and try to avoid any red obstacles that may be in the way. The dots evolve each generation through the use of the Genetic Algorithm. Try it out for yourself! **Note**: Cross-over was simply a clone of the parent's brain since the simulation is relatively simple.

## How to Load Project

Simply clone the Github repository to a local directory and open and run the `main.py` file using an IDE or from the terminal.

## Features

- See how dots' movements evolve as they find their way around obstacles to reach the goal
- Can add more obstacles to see how dots behave
- Implemented the Genetic Algorithm from scratch (fitness calculation, natural selection, cross-over, mutation)
- Use of OOP in Python can be used as template for future projects

## Technologies Used

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - IDE used to build the game
- [Python 3.8.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Programming language used
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - Video game library
